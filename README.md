# 315FinalProject

My group of four members created a web app using R Shiny. 
The web app shows statistical graphics created from a two datasets containing information about the TV show The Office.
The graphics were created using R ggplot,plotly, and html widgets.
The web app is hosted on shinyapps.io.
